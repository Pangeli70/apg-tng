    <h2>Cache management</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    The cache must be enabled explicitly setting the
    <code>useCache: boolean </code> field of the options argument in the
    <code>Init</code> method.
  </p>
  <p>
    <mark>
      It is suggested to disable caches in development. Doing so, every time a
      page will be rendered, the function generation process will be repeated
      (with additional processing overhead), but will be possible to edit the
      HTML files on the fly.<br>
      After having modified the templates it will be possible to see the changes immediately in the
      browser by refreshing the page without restarting Deno.<br>
      The behavior of this option can be overridden by using the
      <code>auseCache</code> argument in the <code>ApgTngService.Render()</code> method.
      Refer to the "Usage" section.

  </p>
  <p>
    The cache is composed of three subsystems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML templates</li>
    <li>Javascript functions</li>
    <li>HTML chunks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The first one is a Map() used to store the HTML templates instead of
    reading them again and again from the disk or from the internet.<br>
    This is almost not very useful, except for debugging purposes. The key of
    the map is the file name with its relative path.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second one is a Map() that stores the actual javascript functions
    generated by the service to render the templates. So once the function is created no further
    access to the local or remote storage is required. <br>
    The key of the map is the file name with its relative path.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third one is another Map() that contains HTML chunks gathered during the
    javascript function creation. The chunk is cached if the number of characters is larger than the
    limit set with the initialization options.<br>
    The key of the map is a hash of the chunk content obtained with a Bryc
    hashing algorithm. This allows to share portions of the pages and reduce the amount of memory used.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important!</b> The three cache systems will store the data even if the
    <code>useCache</code> options flag is false. Those caches are constantly
    updated, so it is possible to browse their content for debugging purposes even if they are not
    used by the <code>ApgTngService.Render()</code> method.

    the three caches associated with this website.
