    <h2>Specific markup</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    The markup inside HTML files used by <code>ApgTngService</code> is
    identified by customizable markup delimiters. The default ones are <code>&#91;: ... :&#93;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside the delimiters, it is possible to write standard javascript code. The
    following reserved words and symbols are used to help the engine to identify
    javascript statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code> function, let, const, =, if, else, switch, case, break, for, do, while, ;, {, }.</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    If none of the preceding is found inside the delimiters the engine supposes
    that the statement is a data value that has to be interpolated inside the HTML output.
  </p>
  <p>
    To customize the behaviour of a template it is possible to pass arguments.
    Those ones are defined by placeholders identified by a number eg.: <code>[#n]</code>.
